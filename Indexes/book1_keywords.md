| Security Architecture |  a communication tool, one to communicate a future state. Its an overall plan on how to implement security at every layer, using technology, processes, & people.  Not extra layer, but focuses on building at Net/Infra, App & Data, Endpoint, & CLoud | 1.4 |
| What Makes a Good Security Architect? | Understanding of networks,infrastructure, applications, information,and business architecture & how eachof these layers deal with risk. <br> - ThinkRED: What are the threatsthat are likely to cause an impact?. <br> - ActBLUE: What are thearchitectural designs andtechnologies that will help me defendagainst them?. <br> - Can balance business & technicalcommunications. <br> - Has good project management skills. <br> - Has a strategic & tactical vision <br> REALIZE THAT SECURITY IS PROBABLY NOT THE CORE BUSINESS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION. <br>  Must have understanding of Business requirements; Regulatory landscape; Threat landscape; IT landscape| 1.6 |
| ARPANET | x4 Computers in late 19060s, was the first TCP/IP network created by the U.S. military, the precursor infrastructure for what we now refer to as the internet; First message was LOGIN, but computer crashed after two letters; <br>  | 1.17 |
| TCP/IP | Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol;  Accepted as the standard for communication on the internet-1983... | 1.17 |
| Morris Worm | Robert Tappan Morris, Jr. released the worm (originally called "the Internet Worm) on November 2, 1988. Hit bell labs hard, affected 10% of Arpanets 60k systems <br> Resulted in the creation of CERT (now us-cert) from lesson learned | 1.18, 23 |

| Mindset, Defensible Sec. Arch | Security is not in opposition to operations: when performed properly, security enhances operations. Example: IDS Packets over GRE w/ over 1500 MTU size causing fragmentation & false positives due to it | 1.21 | 
| GRE Tunnel MTU | Extra 52 bytes added to 1500 (total of 1552) to handle the encapsulation of GRE tunnels, causes fragmentation & directly impact effectiveness of tools & applications, reduce maximum segment size to accomadate | 1.21 |  
| Defensible security architecture |  entirely complementary to traditional network architecture approaches that focus primarily on operations. <br> - Often at the expense of security•The mindset is "build it once, build it right. <br> - All networks must perform their operational functions effectively. <br> - Security can be complementary to this goal. <br> - It is (much) more efficient to bake security in at the outset, rather than retrofitting it later.•For example, your team configures robust logging using a secure template as part of their new router deployment process. <br> - This logging later helps detect an operational issue that is impacting performance. <br> - The problem is solved before users are aware of any issues. **Security is not in the opposition of Ops, but enhances it** | 1.21 |
| Morris Worm | infected 10% of ARPANETs 60k systems, was why firewalls were created, laminated flat networks are bad, CERT, now US-CERT was created as a result | 1.23 |

| George Santanyana | Those who cannot remember past are doomed to repeat it | 1.23 | 
| flat networks | Orgs like because easy to manage, but it **does not** offer internal filtering at OSI Layers 2/3/4 <br> - Must also have ACLs, firewall rules, etc <br> - *VLANs are good, but filtering must also take place.* <br> A flat network allows an intruder to pivot to large number of other systems <br> - For example, if an intruder can compromise one system & then scan TCP port 445(SMB) on hundreds or thousands of others, that network is too flat.<br> These networks fail catastrophically because one compromised system can endanger many others.<br> Segmentation across hybrid networks is required to address this risk. applicable onprem & cloud | 1.24 |
| Failed Mindset, example |  one of most common examples of failed mindset is ”the LAN (or the WAN) is trusted, so why should we...?“ Many bad things have occurred due to this mindset. **Many organizations ignore basic Layer 2 hardening best practices on the flawed assumption** that the black hat requires local access to launch them. Since the black hats are on the outside, there is little to no risk. | 1.26 |
| Hypponen's law | Whenever an appliance is described as being"smart, it's vulnerable | 1.26 |
| IoT, failed mindset | typically is an area where the (typical) buyer and seller of aproduct don't care about security...see hypponens law | 1.26 |
| castle analogy, failed mindset | cloud/mobile/IoT de-perimeterization - walls are the firewall, protecting devices on the inside. The rise of cloud, mobile devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT) makes this less effective | 1.26 |
|  de-perimeterization, cloud/mobile/IoT | castle analogy walls are the firewall, protecting devices on the inside. The rise of cloud, mobile devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT) makes this less effective | 1.26 |
| Prenventive controls | emphasize exploitation prevention - When succesful offers low Total cost of ownershipt, mitigates risk, but Def. In Depth - they will fail eventually | 1.26 | 
| Network Centric Attacks, Failed Mindset | Attacks have moved to the host itself, via Layer 7, and are often leveraging encryption. This makes taking a broader view of architecture critical | 1.26 | 
| Compliance-driven security, Failed Mindset | Can be harmful toward overall information security when it is viewed as the primary security end goal. The goal of compliance is valid, and compliance controls are helpful when part of a larger security process. But being compliant is not enough and tends to fail in the face of a persistent adversary. | 1.27 | 
| shiny object syndrome, failed mindset | implemting tech without analysis, common failure, may give false sense of security or indroduce new risk | 1.27 | 
| Faild Mindset common things | See - IoT, Castle Analogy (false sense), prenventive controls, compliance driven security, shiny object syndrome | 1.26-27 | 
| Presumption of Compromise | <br> Network defenders should always operate under the presumption of compromise<br> - Assume something on the network is already compromised<br> - This forces us to architect and engineer with a different mindset, one focused on anticipating, containing, and limiting damage. <br> *Preventive controls will fail in the face of a persistent adversary* <br> - "Three words sum up my attitude toward stopping intruders: prevention eventually fails."1 —Richard Bejtlich, the Tao of Network Security Monitoring <br> Operating under a presumption of compromise forces us to architect and engineer with a different mindset.  | 1.29 | 
| achieving success in cybersecurity |  characterized as an ongoing process of implementing effective security practices, principles, and hygiene rather than a fixed, static condition. | 1.30 | 
| cyber resiliency | NIST SP 800-160 defines it as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises. <br> Also states that *“cyber resiliency is intended to enable mission or business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be achieved in a contested cyber environment.”* (note: they dont say to prevent all the bad things) | 1.30 | 
| blue/red asymmetries | actions that disrupt real world attacks and offer a great bang for the buck for defenders. This can include using *traditional network and application controls in new zero-trust like ways, and adopting new data-centric, privilege reduction* focused controls | 1.31 | 
| Ruthless prioritization | the practice of taking the most effective actions with the fastest time to value first; done by focusing on effecient blue/red asymmetries; Private Vlans/PVLANS, combining actions with zero trust like transformations, ect.... defenders can focus on practical and eff. countermeasures to disrupt attkrs value propisiton, and increase attack cost and friction | 1.31 | 
| attackers value proposition | disrupting increases cost and friction on the attacker’s ability to succeed | 1.31 | 
|  Critical Assets | Identify and Prioritize <br> A security architect needs to understand the mission(s) of the organization, value chain, and work with business owners toidentify the associated critical assets needed to support them. <br>Create a list of defensible assets and classify themfrom most critical to least critical. <br>If your organization has a BCP, start there. <br>Consider how critical data flows acrossdifferent network zones and user tiers. <br>Align different security levels to zones and tiers. | 1.32 |
| Practical Threat Modeling | Think Red, Act Blue • To anticipate the adversary, we need to determine the characteristics of the adversaries that could be expected to target our systems so we can define and implement effective architectures and controls.•Purple teaming (think red+ act blue) facilitate this by working together through simulation of specific threat scenarios. | 1.33 | 
| Cyber Prep | a threat-oriented approach that allows an organization to define and articulate its threat assumptions to develop organization-appropriate, tailored aspects of a preparedness strategy; focuses on advanced threats, but includes material related to convential threats, can be leveraged standalone or as an extension to other frameworks or threat models.  Helps Orgs understand: <br> - **Governance**: Overall Approach to defending threats, cyber risk managmt integration, and if compliance is aligned to buisness goals <br> - **Operations**: Continous Monitoring, Response/IR effectiveness, CTI utilization, and cyber cross-domain integration and effectivness. <br> - **Architecture and Engineering**: Cyber's operational integration, buisness alignment, CSF effectiveness to address cyber resilency, and orginizational security alignment | 1.33 | 
| ATT&CK Matrix | Provides a common languageto describe adversarial tacticsand techniques<br>Applicable to realenvironments, allow mappingthe attacker’s behaviors todefenses<br>Go-to model to plan andverify purple teaming exercises <br> rovides a public repository of threat groups including “intent” and “capabilities.”; Helps us to focus on risk | 1.34,35 |
| Orangeworm | a group that has targeted organizations in the healthcare sector in the United States, Europe, and Asia since at least 2015, likely for the purpose of corporate espionage. | 1.35 |
| APT41 | a group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity. APT41 has been active since as early as 2012. The group has been observed targeting healthcare, telecom, technology, and video game industries in 14 countries|1.35|
| FIN4 | is a financially motivated threat group that has targeted confidential information related to the public financial market, particularly regarding healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, since at least 2013. FIN4 is unique in that they do not infect victims with typical persistent malware, but rather they focus on capturing credentials authorized to access email and other nonpublic correspondence.|1.35|
| Act Blue | ID Mismatches Between Adversary and Organization’s Strategy Using MITRE ATT&CKNavigator,1we canoverlay attacker’s TTPswith our organizationalcapabilities forvisibility and detection.•Identifying gaps incoverage allow us toprioritize defensivestrategy based onthreat intel data.| 1.35|
| ATT&CK Navigator | is an open-source tool to visualize attackers' TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), defensive coverage, red/blue team planning, and facilitate gap analysis. <br> **Princile Feature**: ability to define layers/custom views that creates heat maps..........By default, the ATT&CK Navigator will present a matrix view of the tactics and techniques matrix for Enterprise ATT&CK. This matrix is presented as a JSON layer. <br> Navigator to visualize your defensive coverage, your red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques; allows ID Gaps to prioritize defensive stategy based on threat intel | 1.36 |
| ATT&CK | attacker actions and behaviors can be modeled effectively using MITRE ATT&CK | 1.48 |  
| DeTT&CT functionality | - Administrate and score the quality of your data sources.<br> - Get insight on the visibility you have on endpoints.<br> - Map your detection coverage.<br> - Map threat actor behaviors.<br> - Compare visibility, detections, and threat actor behaviors to uncover possible improvements in detection and visibility. This can help you to prioritize your blue teaming efforts.<br> - The colored visualizations are created with the help of ATT&CKNavigator | 1.37 | 
| DeTT&CT | an open-source project that aims to assist blue teams using ATT&CK to score and compare data log source quality, visibility coverage, detection coverage, and threat actor behaviors. All of this can help, in different ways, to get more resilient against attacks targeting your organization. | 1.37 | 
| Schwartua | Security Maven Dude...Talked about PDR and Timebased Security | 1.44 |
| Time-Based Security | Usually applied to auditing, time-based security can be a very practical model to assess and design security architectures (**P**rotect-**D**etect-**R**espond); While prevention works, detecting and responding early help to mitigate impact | 1.44 |
| Physical Security, Time | Everything in the physical security world is about time. | 1.45 |
| Kill Chain |  aka Intrusion Kill Chain is amodel designed by Lockheed Martin.  The metaphor: if you break the chain before the end, the attacker fails <br> The Kill Chain is (often) applied inthe context of malware and perimeter defenses...*Many criticize it for this reason*. <br> Can also be applied toother contexts, and the metaphor is quite useful.•The steps are:**Reconnaissance**-**Weaponizationo**-**Delivery**-**Exploitation**-**Installation**-**Command and control**-**Actions on objectives**<br>; break chain, stop adversary...comes from older find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess. | 1.46 |
| Kill Chain Countermeasures | Largely infrastructure centric... **D**etect-**D**eny-**D**isrupt-**D**egrade -**D**eceive; Mostly Infra Centric, Most companies invest in Deny and Disrupt-prevention based w/ lower TCO. Detecive Controls are often lacking.  Degrade and Decieve are missing from many large orgs, but they are not as high priority as preventive... | 1.47 |
| lateral movement / breakout point | effective solution allows a SOC the objective to block, detect, and react as early as possible in the attack timeline, knowing that once the attacker has stolen credentials and started lateral movement, their advantage and the impact of the attack grows exponentially | 1.48 | 
| OODA - Observe, Orient, Decide, Act | provide the context that blue teamers and security operations teams need to make tactical defensive decisions. | 1.48 |
| attack-blocking protection | slows downthe offender, buying the defendervaluable time to respond and forcing the attacker to change their approach. Blocks are inherently high-fidelity and high-priority detections | 1.48 | 
| exposure time | (Exposure = Detection + Reaction) | 1.48 |
| Visibility and Detection | Most prevention and detection-oriented tools make poor threat hunting solutions<br> - >Why?•**Prevention and real-time detectionare focused on low FPs**<br> - >Hunting solutions rely on visibility and should be optimized for low FNs<br> - >Detecting or doing triage is reactive. ***Threat hunting is proactive.*** | 1.49 |
| Visibility, Detection | in this context, refers to the ability to obtain raw telemetry from various data sources, including the network, endpoint, and cloud. | 1.49 |
| IPS/IDS - Detection | for some, may tell you that something bad was detected and maybe even blocked, but you don’t have the full “footage” of what happened in that session. You have detection, but not necessarily full visibility. | 1.49 | 
| False Positives | will eventually suffer from false negatives.  Address by architecting for visibility... Detection Workflows (reactive), and Threat Hunting (Proactive)  | 1.49 |
| Detection Workflows - Arch. Visibility Strat. | - Detection workflows (reactive) –> Alert –> Incident Response; Reactive architect startegy for visibiility, proactive will be threat-hunting| 1.49 |
| Threat Hunting - Arch. Visibility Strat. | TH(Proactive) -> in the absence of an alert and knowing how adversaries behave (their TTPs) search for the presence of the adversary in the organization (presumption of compromise), finding those false negatives that were not picked up by protection or detection | 1.49 | 
| IR Hierarchy of Needs | The Incident Response Hierarchy1is modeled after Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It describes the capabilities that organizations must build to defend their business assets. Bottom capabilities are prerequisites for successful execution of the capabilities above them. | 1.50 | 
| Zero Trust Model | Forrester’s original Zero Trust Model (2010) removes the concept of "internal is trusted, external is not."•It requires an organization to: <br> ...go through a state of transformation by ***eliminating the idea of a trusted network*** regardless of whether it is an internal or external network, and ***redesigning networks from the inside out***. In the Zero Trust Model of information security, we ***assume that all traffic is untrusted***. This approach demands that you build security into the DNA of your IT architecture. <br> This new model was officially published in NIST SP 800-207 in late 2020. | 1.51 | 
| NIST SP 800-207 | Zero trust architecture, published 2020 | 1.51-52 | 
| Zero Trust, US Gov | Breaches like solar wind dictate effort - The guide that NSA released in February 2021 shows how it could of mitigated many attacks.   NSA Notes that should be implemented accross all aspects of a network and operations ecosystems to be fully effecitive | 1.52 |
| Zero Trust Pillars and Maturity Model, CISA ZTMM | approach to achieve continued modernization efforts related to zero trust within a rapidly evolving environment and technology landscape. This ZTMM is one of many paths that an organization can take in designing and implementing their transition plan to zero trust architectures in accordance with **Executive Order (EO) 14028** | 1.54 | 
| ZTMM - CISA  | Zero Trust Pillars and Maturity Model, an approach to achieve continued modernization efforts related to zero trust within a rapidly evolving environment and technology landscape. This ZTMM is one of many paths that an organization can take in designing and implementing their transition plan to zero trust architectures in accordance with **Executive Order (EO) 14028** | 1.54 | 
| Zero Trust Implementation 5 Pillars | ZTMM represents a gradient of implementation across five distinct pillars, in which minor advancements can be made over time toward optimization. The pillars include ***Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications and Workloads, and Data***. Each pillar includes general details regarding the following cross-cutting capabilities: ***Visibility and Analytics, Automation*** and Orchestration, and Governance. | 1.54-55 | 
| ZTMM Pillar - Identity | An identity refers to an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely describes a user or entity,including non-person entities. Organizations need the ability to continuously authenticate, authorize, andmonitor activity patterns to govern users’ access and privileges while protecting and securing all interactions. | 1.54 |
| ZTMM Pillar - Device  | A device refers to any asset (including its hardware, software, firmware, etc.) that can connect to anetwork, including servers, desktop and laptop machines, printers, mobile phones, IoT devices, networkingequipment, and more. Having the ability to identify, authenticate, authorize, inventory, isolate, secure,remediate, and control all devices is essential in a zero trust approach. | 1.54 |
| ZTMM Pillar - Network |  A network refers to an open communications medium including typical channels such as internalnetworks, wireless networks, and the Internet as well as other potential channels such as cellular andapplication-level channels used to transport messages. Segment (both logically and physically), isolate, andcontrol the network/environment (on-premises and off-premises) with granular access and policy restrictions. As the perimeter becomes more granular through macro-segmentation, micro-segmentation provides greater protections and controls over data/assets/applications/services. It is critical to (a) control privileged access, (b) manage internal and external data flows, and (c) prevent lateral movement. | 1.54 | 
| ZTMM Pillar - Applications and Workload |  Applications and workloads include systems, computer programs, and services that execute on-premises, on mobile devices, and in cloud environments. Zero trust workloads span the complete application stack from application layer to hypervisor. Securing and properly managing the application layer as well as compute containers and virtual machines is central to zero trust adoption. Application delivery methods such as proxy technologies enable additional protections to include zero trust decision and enforcement points. | 1.54 | 
| ZTMM Pillar - Data | Data includes all structured and unstructured files and fragments that reside or have resided in systems, devices, networks, applications, databases, infrastructure, and backups (including on-premise and virtual environments), as well as the associated metadata. Zero trust protects critical data, assets, applications, and services. A clear understanding of an organization’s data/assets/applications/services is critical for a successful implementation of zero trust architecture. Organizations need to categorize their data/assets/applications/services in terms of mission criticality and use this information to develop a comprehensive data management strategy as part of their overall zero trust approach. This can be achieved through the cate gorization of data, development of schemas, and encryption of data at rest and in transit. Solutions such as DRM, DLP, software-defined storage, and granular data-tagging are relevant for protecting critical data. | 1.54 |
| Identity - ZTMM Pillar | An identity refers to an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely describes a user or entity,including non-person entities. Organizations need the ability to continuously authenticate, authorize, andmonitor activity patterns to govern users’ access and privileges while protecting and securing all interactions. | 1.54 |

| cross-cutting capabilities - ZTMM 3 (***CCCs**) | 3 of them that highlight activities to support interoperability and integration of functions across pillars: **Visibility and Analytics**, **Automation and Orch**. **Governance** | 1.55 |
| ZTMM CCC - Visibility and Analytics |   Visibility refers to the observable artifacts that result from the characteristics of and events within enterprise-wide environments. The focus on cyber-related data analysis can help inform policy decisions, facilitate response activities, and build a risk profile to develop proactive security measures before an incident occurs. | 1.55 |
| ZTMM CCC - Automation and Orchestration |  Zero trust makes full use of automated tools and workflows that support security response functions across products and services while maintaining oversight, security, and interaction of the development process for such functions, products, and services. | 1.55 |
| ZTMM CCC - Governance |  Governance refers to the definition and associated enforcement of agency cybersecurity policies, procedures, and processes, within and across pillars, to manage an agency’s enterprise and mitigate security risks in support of zero trust principles and fulfillment of federal requirements. | 1.55 |
| NCSC - UK National Cyber Security Centre  | released guidance aimed at those implementing a zero trust architecture in an enterprise environment, including public and private sectors. | 1.56 | 
| UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) | released guidance aimed at those implementing a zero trust architecture in an enterprise environment, including public and private sectors. | 1.56 | 
| NCSC Zero Trust principles, **UK** | **1.** Know your architecture, including users, devices, services, and data: In order to get the benefits from zerotrust, you need to know about each component of your architecture <br> **2. Know your user, service, and device identities:** An identity can represent a user (a human), service (softwareprocess) or device. Each identity should be unique and cryptographically identifiable in a zero trustarchitecture. <br> **3. Assess your user behavior, devices, and services health:** User behavior, and service or device health, areimportant indicators when looking to establish confidence in the security of your systems, making themimportant signals for policy engines. <br> **4. Use policies to authorize requests:** Each request for data or services should be authorized against a policy.The power of a zero trust architecture comes from the access policies you define.  Key component. Uses Multiple signals and provides secure access control mechinis. <br> **5. Authenticat and Authorize everywhere:** Authentication and authorization decisions should consider multiplesignals, such as device location, device health, user identity, and status to evaluate the risk associated withthe access request. <br>**6. Focus your monitoring on users, devices, and services**: In a zero trust architecture, it is highly likely that yourmonitoring strategy will change to focus on users, devices, and service behaviors.  Monitoring should link back to policies to cain assurance in their configuraiton.  <br> **7. Don't trust any network, including your own:** Don't trust any network between the device and the service it's accessing, including the local network. Communications over a network, to access data or services, should use a secure transport protocol to gain assurance that your traffic is protected in transit and less susceptible to threats. <br> **8. Choose services designed for zero trust:** Services may not support zero trust and thus may require additional resources to integrate and increase support overhead. In these scenarios it may be prudent to consider alternative products and services that have been designed with zero trust in mind. | 1.56-57 |
| Stained Glass-Windows of Vendors Marketing | Forrester Ack. ZT became marketing ploy. | 1.58 | 
| Canadian Centre for Cyber Security | acknowledges that “preventing lateral movement is the primary goal of ZT, not the elimination of the legacy boundary defence or bring your own device (BYOD). These are things that may be enabled by ZT but should not be seen as primary reason for doing ZT.” | 1.58 |  
| Zero Trust, Model for Infosec | Forrester admits it translates to a data-centric network and security architecture, one that can be worked toward but without an ultimate end state. | 1.58 | 
| Less Implicit Trust | This can seem intimidating for companies that still use the "candy bar" design; here is one way to start <br> **1.** New projects/technologies: use Zero Trust. **2.** Look for “easy wins” to convert existing technologies to a Zero Trust mindset. **3.** Replace legacy technology over time.<br> As NCSC acknowledges, following ZT principles is the ideal approach when choosing new services or building a network from scratch, but this may not be possible for an existing network where legacy systems are in use. | 1.59 |

Based on SABSA Sec Arch.life cycle: Strategy and Planning -> Design -> Implement -> Manage and Measure  Also leverages concepts from the Deming PDSA Cycle (Plan-Do-Study-Ac control model, traditional project management, and the Six Sigma DMAIC model). | 1.62 | 
| DARIOM - Discover and Assess | - Identify requirements, business and regulatory -HIPAA, PCI, SOX, GDPR, etc. Leverage BCP and GRC documentation. <br> - Identify assets in scope (data, users, devices) and how data flows.- Understand business and risk appetite. <br> - Identify resources available: tools, budget, personnel, skills, time.- Practical threat modeling and risk analysis <br> -Attack surface analysis, data flow and egress analysis, network visibility analysis, and protocol visibility analysis -Red teaming: impact analysis (think offensive), realistic scenarios based on attacker’s TTPs <br> **A practical example of doing this is threat, vulnerability, and data flow analysis.** | 1.63 |
| Unknown Unknowns | Former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld addressing NATO in 2002: <br> There are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say there are things that we now know we don't know. But thereare also unknown unknowns. There are things we don't know we don't know. <br> **Examples** that apply to network monitoring: **Known**: we know that we can see credentials in clear text protocols. **Known unknown**: we know we have IPv6, but we are ignoring it. **Unknown unknown**: we don’t know that our browsers are using QUIC/HTTP3 right now and are completely unaware of these attack vectors. | 1.64 | 
| IPv6 traffic | accounts for over 40% of internet backbone traffic as of September 2023 | 1.64 | 
| QUIC/HTTP/3  | QUIC is part of HTTP3, uses UDP port 443:  HTTP/3 is the third version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), previously known as HTTP-over-QUIC. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) was initially developed by Google and is the successor of HTTP/2. Companies such as Google and Facebook have already been using QUIC to speed up the web | 1.64 | 
| Attack Surface Analysis | Attack surface describes all the vectors for exploitation, 3 basic categories. Network, Software, and Human Attack Surfaces. | 1.65 | 
| Egress Analysis | - A required part of the network attack surface analysis process, what/how preventive controls prohibit data out of network  | 1.66 |

| Network Visibility Analysis | involves determining where the “blind spots” are: places where malware can pivot without being seen by an IDS, IPS, full packet capture, NetFlow, etc., Client Access Networks common examples.  Incorp. additional network vis. in these spots, NSM/IDS attached to spans, ect. | 1.67 | 
| Protocol Visibility Analysis | goal is to become aware of all the protocols being used on a network and describe their business purpose. Use Traffic captures 1.68 |

| Implement, DARIOM | Implement based on security architecture design; Harden at each layer, Network-centric, -Data-centric;  Enable logging for monitoring;   Determine baseline: Device configurations and traffic flows; Validate implementation | 1.70 | 
| Operate and Monitor, DAROM |  Continuous security monitoring-Data at rest: registry keys, windows event logs, DNS, etc.-   Network security monitoring-Data in motion: NetFlow, transactional, pcaps-   Continue creating awareness, maintaining threat-focused operations, and augmenting visibility based on threat intel and IR lessons learned | 1.71 | 
| USB-based operation campaigns | Majority of incidents can be attributed to several campaings w/ USB stuff; affecting both the public and private sectors globally. 2023 a threefold increase in the number of attacks using infected USBs. | 1.78 | 
| Physical Inspection | Annual Assesments, look at considerations and impact of gaining physical access...badges, social (wearing uniform), what can happen if gained.  | 1.76 | 
| Physical, Threat | Network Cabinets, Backuptapes, Server Rooms, USB, Dropboxes/devices lan turtle, OMG-Cables, rouge devices, multitool devices like flipper zero | 1.78 | 
| Physical Access, Layer 1 | Secure Access to facilities, devices, and systems need to be secured | 1.79 | 
| drop box | inexpensive system designed to be physically deployed inside a building after gaining temporary physical access. They can be built for less than $100 US, cheap enough to be deployed and lost. Example: Raspberry Pi with "WarBerryPi" installed | 1.79 | 
| WarBerryPi | built to be used as a hardware implant during red teaming scenarios where we want to obtain as much information as possible in a short period of time with being as stealth as possible. Just find a network port and plug it in. The scripts have been designed in a way that the approach is targeted to avoid noise in the network that could lead to detection and to be as efficient as possible. The WarBerry script is a collection of scanning tools put together to provide that functionality | 1.79 | 
| Weaponized USB Keyboards | Rubber ducky example. USB keyboards are not mitigated by controls such as autorun, which mitigate USB disks. The keyboards require a logged-in user, and once inserted, are able to run any command the logged-in user has permission to run. The typical approach is to download a Metasploit Meterpreter payload and run it. The payload would connect outbound to a listening agent running on an attacker’s system, proving inbound access to the compromised system. | 1.80 | 
| Rubber Ducky |  USBkeyboard in the size/shape of USB thumb drive; can be loaded with payloads that are able to typecommands on a logged-in computer.  Commands may include: Disable the firewall and antivirus.Surf to a website, download a malicious payload, and execute it. <br> The newest Rubber Ducky ships with a major upgrade tothe DuckyScript programming language, which is usedt o create the commands that the Rubber Ducky willenter into the victim machine. | 1.80 | 
| USB Keyboard Attacks |  Mitigations Are Limited; USB devices have PIDs (Product IDs) and VIDs (Vendor IDs); devices could be restricted to using approved PIDs and VIDs, but can also be spoofed by the USB devices. For sites requiring high security, mitigations include facility security and physically blocking USB devices. Use of devices with populated serial numbers to lock down. | 1.81 | 
| Layer 1 Mitigations | Solid Layer 1 and Layer 2 security is the best way to mitigate the risk of many Layer 1 attacks, including wired penetration testing drop boxes. This begins with facility security. The next step is disabling all unused switch ports and placing them on an unused VLAN; this provides defense in depth, should the wrong port be accidentally re-enabled. Then use either MAC address filtering (MACsec), 802.1X, and/or NAC to mitigate further the risk of unknown devices being plugged into the network. | 1.82 |
| wireless drop boxes |typically “phone home” to the penetration tester via a cellular connection and attempt to hack the local Wi-Fi connection via 802.11. Ex: Metasploit on an Android cellphone w/ both a cellular and 802.11 adapter built in. **Difficult to mitigate:** one of these phones could be mailed into the building. Solid Wi-Fi and Bluetooth security are the best mitigations. | 1.82 | 
| Physical Access, Redisgn and Implement | Defense in Depth approach. Use Color-coding and quality cables, Track access of all persons; Secure entry exits.  Backround checks. | 1.83 | 
| Wireless, Layer 1 |  Multiple forms of wireless network communication; 802.11 – Wireless standards and Wi-Fi technologies; Bluetooth– Low-bandwidth, short-range; Zigbee– Low-power, low-bandwidth, short-range; Z-Wave– Low-power, low-bandwidth, short-range; Cellular– Mobile networking over a wide area; Infrared– Short-range communication (cannot penetrate walls); Radio-frequency identification (RFID) – Active or passive short-range communication often used for inventory or badges | 1.84 | 
| Zigbee , Layer 1 | – Low-power, low-bandwidth, short-range, 65K node support. | 1.84 | 
| Z-Wave , Layer 1 | – Low-power, low-bandwidth, short-range, 232 Nodes, | 1.84 | 
| Wireless Risk | An attack against a wireless device requires proximity to the device. However, proximity to a device does not require an adversary to be present. For example, malware can spread by taking over internet-facing devices such as security cameras, wireless routers, and mobile phones. Once infected, the wireless communication protocols on these devices can be used to target other systems. All of this is possible without human intervention or presence | 1.85 | 
| WIPS | An "evil twin" is a rogue access point masquerading as a legitimate access point (AP).; Possible by spoofing the BSSID of legitimate AP; May include denial of service against legitimate AP; Often combined with Machine-in-the-Middle attacks and phishing. <br> WIPS offers the ability to detect and protect against rogue access points; One or more radios scan for nearby wireless devices; May require a scheduled scan on older devices or continuous mode on new devices; May combine wireless scan information with wired scan information; Report and alert on rogue devices.; May deauthenticate clients or rogue APs (beware legal ramifications) | 1.86 | 
| WIPS Containment over the Air• | Commercial WIPS can  contain these attacks by sending de-authentication packets with the spoofed MAC address of the rogue access point (the BSSID of the rogue wireless network). •The de-authentication packets force any clients that are connected to the rogue access point to disconnect. | 1.87 | 
| 6 GHz |  containment will not work because 6 GHz uses protected management frame and it would not be possible to contain the clients over the air | 1.87 | 
| WPA3 | Enterprise – WPA2 + PMFs + Stronger Ciphers.... builds upon WPA2 and it is meant to replace it in the future. It’s the first major update to Wi-Fisecurity since 2004.; Includes better authentication, increased cryptographic strength, and the use ofProtected Management Frames (PMFs) toincrease network security.; There’s optional 192-bit security. All involvedparties need to support 192-bit security mode,or no connection will be established.; Commonly placed in high-security Wi-Finetworks such as in government, defense,finance, and other industries.; Follows a similar process as the one in WPA2,enhanced due to stronger ciphers. <br>  Bad news is that all involved parties (access points, clients, and RADIUS-server) need to support this 192-bit security mode. 802.1X SSID should also be separated/encapsulated from other traffic in your network| 1.88 | 
| WPA3 | announced by the Wi-Fi Alliance in 2018, introduced new features to simplify Wi-Fi security, including enabling better authentication, increased cryptographic strength, and requiring the use of Protected Management Frames (PMFs) to increase network security.  Uses 192-bit sec; enforced on client and Radius server w/ Enterprise. bad news is that all involved parties (access points, clients, and RADIUS-server) need to support this 192-bit security mode. 802.1X SSID should also be separated/encapsulated from other traffic in your network to prvent id'ing *"weakest entrance”* by looking for other, non-192-bit-mode SSIDs connected to the same network and attack them.To use WPA3 enterprise, the RADIUS serversmustuse one of the permitted EAP ciphers:  •TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 •TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 •TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM; <br> WPA3 192-bit security will be exclusive for EAP-TLS, which will require certificates on both STA and RADIUS server.| 1.88-89 | 
| Guest Access |  could require no authentication and the internet only; likely need a terms and conditions page to limit liability; "Special guests" such as vendors may need internal access.; ; A common practice to use WPA2 with PSK for vendor SSID; This often is not secure enough. PSKs tend to be shared with the world.; An alternative is to create temporary accounts per guest user.; Most wireless solutions also support custom registration pages.; A form asks about who is requesting access and for what purpose.; Details of the form and approval grant dynamic access. **Remember to disable management services on guest interfaces! ** | 1.9O | 
| Station Isolation | client on a wireless access point may speak to the AP (which is also a switch and a router) only. Clients may not access other clients on the same AP; also called client isolation; Default behavior between vendors varies.; Guest networks should have station isolation enabled.oPrevents infections from spreading from guest to guest; Highly recommend enabled for all wireless access; <br>Station isolation prevents direct traffic between wireless clients that connect to the same SSID on the same radio.  **Does not** prevent direct traffic between wireless clients that connect to the SSID on different AP devices.9 | 1.91 |
| pure guest mode, Wireless Station Isolation | clients may not access any other devices, wireless or wired, and can simply reach the AP (which is also a switch and a router), and route to the internet. **Not appropriate for enterprise** | 1.91 |
| Station Isolation issues |  may create problems in some environments where wireless clients send traffic to each other on the same Layer 2 LAN; home network would mean a wireless laptop would not be able to connect to other wireless devices. Smart TVs, AppleTV, Roku, Amazon FireTV, Chromecast, etc.; usually an issue unique to homes and small/simple wireless networks, less common in well-designed corporate networks; but Private VLANs can cause additonal issues | 1.93 | 
| Zigbee, securing | operates in one of three modes:<br> Unsecured Mode –No security enabled<br> Access Control List (ACL) Mode – MAC-based access control<br> Secured Mode –Uses a combination of:<br> Access Control – Uses MAC address<br> Frame Encryption – Encrypts frame using AES symmetric key<br> Frame Integrity – Prevents frame from being altered in transit<br> Sequential Freshness – Countermeasure against replay attacksLow-level security is part of IEEE 802.15.4. High-level security is part of the ZigBee standard <br> High-level security operates at a higher level of the OSI layer and uses AES cryptography to provide encryption, authentication, and integrity. This includes things such as a 32-bit frame counter maintained for every node. Frame counter increments as each packet is received. If a frame is received that does not contain the correct frame counter, then that frame is dropped. <br> Critical aspect is the effect cryptography has on the battery life of a device. Devices must last at least two years to pass certification. Turning on integrity or encryption controls impacts the batteries’ lifespan| 1.94 | 
| Private cellular | LTE/5G, CBRS and 5G LAN for IoT use cases growing in adoption among manufacturing, warehouses, healthcare, schools and municipalities.  150 megahertz band of spectrum that operates in the 3,550 MHz to 3,700 MHz range. Function identically to public 5G. <br> Endpoints must be cellular-capable -- and CBRS-compatible -- and connect to the private wireless network via physical Subscriber Identity Modules or embedded SIMs. **Private 5G provides no encryption to data sent from the core to the internet**| 1.95 |
| Switches, Discover and Assess | Common basic issues relatedto switches (routers too): Secure administration; Services offered; Vulnerabilities; ACLs; Banners; Logging; Authentication, authorization, and accounting | 1.98 |
|  Switches, Threats |  MAC flooding attacks; 802.1Q and ISL tagging attack; Double-encapsulated 802.1Q/VLAN hopping; ARP attacks; Private VLAN attack; VLAN trunking protocol attack; Multicast brute force attack; Spanning-tree attack; Random frame stress attack | 1.99 |
|  CDP, Hardening | CDP is a Layer 2 plaintext broadcast protocol designed for troubleshooting. - It allows Cisco devices to “see” each other.<br> CDP leaks a lot of critical information toevery system on the subnet.<br> CDP should be disabled unless expresslyrequired.<br> Cisco IOS command to disable CDP globally:o Router(config)# no cdp run<br> CDP may also be disabled per interface:o Router(config-if)# no cdp enable | 1.1OO | 
| Link Layer Discovery Protocol(LLDP) | vendor-neutral link-layer protocol used by many network devices to perform the same function as CDP, including advertising their identity, capabilities, and neighbors on a network. LLDP can also generally be disabled globally (on Cisco IOS: 'no lldp run') or per interface (on Cisco IOS: 'no lldp transmit', 'no lldpreceive'). | 1.1OO |
| Port Security | Can be used to mitigate Spoofing; can mitigate the risk of rogue devices.  Many incidents begin when a pre-infected device such as a laptop is plugged into a switch that requests and receives a DHCP address...Mitigation with port security uses hardcoded MAC addresses or 'sticky' MAC addresses; Stronger mitigation is possible with 802.1X and NAC (Network Access Control) | 1.103 | 
| Hardcoded MAC Addresses | One simple (but high-maintenance) option is to hard code theMAC address of each connected system.oUnused ports should be “shut down,” requiring enabling on the switch before they may be used. Sample client configuration: <br> interface FastEthernet0
| Sticky Mac | example in book, common sense shit | 1.106 | 
| Mac Limiting | same as sticky mac, but dont forget the policy violation shutdown/trip and snmp sutff | 1.106 | 
| ARP attacks | Target end systems.<br> Some of the worst internal attacks feature ARP spoofing and ARP cache poisoning; ARP spoofing remaps an IP address to a new illegitimate MAC address; ARP cache poisoning tricks a system into caching the spoofed ARP entry.<br>ARP spoofing requires local Layer 2 (LAN) access, which makes many sites consider these attacks low probability (and therefore low risk); The reality is that sites may be one click away from an infected host; If an attacker can escalate privileges to root or administrator/system, they may attempt ARP spoofing; Machine-in-the-Middle (MitM) is a common attack: remap the default gateway to another host; New (bogus) gateway knows where the real one is and can pass traffic accordingly | 1.107 | 
| gratuitous ARP |  ARP reply with no matching request, can be used to do Arp poisioning | 1.109 | 
| ARP default cache, NIX | 60 seconds; you may check the setting with this command:#cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_stale_time | 1.109 | 
| ARP Default Cache, Windows | Older versions of Windows had a default ARP cache timeout of two minutes. On Windows Vista and newer, the default ARP cache timeout is randomly set between 15 and 45 seconds. ARP cache settings command shows it....(listed as “Reachable Time”):  C:\> netsh interface ipv4 show interface <interface number>| 1.109 | 
| ARP Cache Poisoning | Done by Race (last reply wins), or gratutios arp | 1.109 | 
| Dynamic Arp Inspection (DAI) | Mitigates Arp Spoofing/Poisening by intercepting all requests and validating.  DAI Determins validty based on mapping in trusted db that is built at runtime by DHCP snooping, must be enabled on all vlans.  Can also validate user created ACLs / static mappings. Can be configured to drop all ARP Packets when not matching reqs...Enable DAI on int example: (int0/5)#ip arp inspection trust | 1.11O |
| DHCP Starvation | simple attack, where one malicious system requests all available DHCP addresses in the pool. Most DHCP servers have no built-in defenses against this type of attack, so the switch must be configured to stop it | 1.111 | 
| Rogue DHCP Server | often follows A DHCP starvation attack.•Once the real DHCP server is out of leases, a rogue server canthen serve addresses as well as additional information.oIncluding the default gateway, DNS, etc.•This makes launching Machine-in-the-Middle attacks quite easy.•It also allows the rogue server to send clients forged DNSresponses, directing clients to malicious sites. | 1.112 | 
| DHCP Attack Mitigations | DHCP snooping filters DHCP requests sent to untrusted interfaces...Enable it on a switch: ***#ip dhcp snooping***  •Configure a trusted interface (the DHCP server interface):***#interface FastEthernet0/5***   ***#ip dhcp snooping trust***  •Then enable DHCP snooping non-DHCP server VLANs: #ip dhcp snooping vlan 530 <br> Be sure to send switch logs to a centralized syslog server or SIEM;  DHCP snooping violations will create logs containing the string " **%DHCP_SNOOPING-5-DHCP_SNOOPING_UNTRUSTED_PORT"**: | 1.114 | 
| Private VLANs (PVLANs)| VLAN is often defined as a "broadcast domain,"  PVLANs are the exception to this; a private VLAN is still usually a single IP subnet, but the "broadcast domain" definition no longer holds true. In a private VLAN, an "uplink" port (also called a "promiscuous" port) is defined. Normally the port (or link aggregation group) attached to the uplink router(s), firewall(s), provider network, or server(s).  Then "isolated" ports are set. Any frame received on an isolated port is forwarded only to the uplink port, no matter what destination MAC or IP address it might have. <br> Private Ports can be expanded to include larger port groups; this concept is called "community" ports. Community ports can speak to each other via Layer 2 just like a regular VLAN, but they are separated from ports in other communities and from isolated ports.| 1.118 | 
| community ports |  can speak to each other via Layer 2 just like a regular VLAN, but they are separated from ports in other communities and from isolated ports. | 1.118 | 
| Private VLANs Issues | Most have workarounds, but involves poorly designed that intermingle clients / svrs, P2P (audio/vidio)/Enterprise Gateways, Win10 P2P Patching (not rec for enterp.) | 1.12O | 
| Private VLAN Ports | Prosmiscous (any traffic, usually GWs), Isolated (can only talk to Prom), Community (send to prom. or community, but not issolated) | 1.121 | 
| Primary and Secondary VLANs | Private VLANs support primary and secondary VLANs.oAll systems on the LAN are part of the primary VLAN.oSystems may also be part of secondary VLANs, such as isolated or community VLANs. (see slide for commands)| 1.123 | 
| VTP w/ PVLAN | VTP versions 1 and 2 are not compatible with private VLANs. VTP version 3 can transfer information regarding Private VLAN (PVLAN) structures | 1.125 | 
| VTP Transparent mode | VTP transparent switches do not participate in VTP. A VTP transparent switch does not advertise its VLAN configuration and does not synchronize its VLAN configuration based on received advertisements, but transparent switches do forward VTP advertisements that they receive out their trunk ports in VTP | 1.125 | 
| Network Flows | Tprovides a log of what happens between two systems; includes source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and start and end time of the connection. Flow data may also include additional details such as the sourcing network interface. | 1.128 | 
| Flow Data Sources | **Traditional:** Direct from network equipment; Switches/Routers/SDNs; NetFlow/sFlow/JFlow/IPFIX; Firewalls; VPN appliances; Hypervisor networking; Includes cloud flow generation; Example: Amazon VPC Flows or Azure Network Watcher.  <br> **Untraditional**: Generate flows from network monitoring; Suricata; Zeek; PacketbeatsGenerate flows from endpoints; Packetbeats; Sysmon | 
| Flow Data, Why? | Commparison between sigin/commint... Summerizes Network Traffic. Good for L2-4 Graphs, id's top/bottom N traffic.  Can see DoS attacks, annomolies, beaconing, data exfil, lat movement.  Summerize Encypted Traffic.  Allows "Know thy Network" | 1.13O | 
| NetFlow | NetFlow is a proprietary standard created by Cisco that summarizes network traffic, based on frame and packet headers.•NetFlow is V9 (also branded as Flexible Netflow or FNF); Data reported/included Byte and packet counts; ProtocoloSource and destination addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) and netmasks; IP and TCP flags, TCP and UDP ports and ICMP types and codes; Interface used; BGP information including Autonomous System, ect... <br> IPFIX, an open standard often referred as Netflow v10, has grown as a popular alternative to Netflow. Cisco's IOS-XE based platforms now support both FNF and IPFIX.| 1.131 | 
| Netflow V9 | expanded to handle more type of protocols, including IPv6, GRE, BGP, MPLS, and others. NetFlow V9 was initially described by RFC 3954.  Records are grouped into **FlowSets** | 1.131 | 
| IPFIX | IP Flow Information Export, was created as a more universal solution to collecting/analyzing vital network data. Works with Cisco, but can also include wide range of vendor products/devices.  Vendors who are currently utilizing IPFIX include Barracuda Networks, Nortel, Xirrus/Juniper Networks, among others. | 1.131 | 
| Security Onion Flow Data |(Zeek and Snort/Suricata) is used to create flow data, know that it has the capability to filter out data at each sensor. This is done within /etc/nsm/bpf.conf and uses standard BPF syntax. | 1.133 | 
| Flow Planning | Need to ensure to plan for data duplication.  Happens freq. w/ flow data.  Handled 1 of 2 ways; Flow exlusions (most devices dont support) or log aggregation and filtering. If Security Onion (Bro, Snort/Suricata) is used to create flow data, know that it has the capability to filter out data at each sensor. This is done within /etc/nsm/bpf.conf and uses standard BPF syntax. | 1.133 | 
| NetFlow Exporters, Nix | variety of NetFlow exporters available for Linux. One of the easiest to set up is "fprobe"; | 1.134 | 
| fprobe | netflow exporter for nix | 1.134 |
| Neflow Exporter, Cisco | <br> **(config)# ip flow-export destination netflow.sec530.com udp-port 2055** <br> **(config)# ip flow-export version 9** <br> Then configure each interface to export NetFlow: <br> **(config)#interface GigabitEthernet0/0** <br> **(config-if)#ip flow egress** sends outbound interface traffic, 'ingress' sends inbound•Linux syntax is in the notes. | 1.134 |
| Cloud Flows | Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) may support exporting flow data.•Export process different than traditional flowsAmazon supports VPC flows. Requires flows to be exported to CloudWatch1•Or an S3 bucket2•Most SIEM solutions natively read files from S3.•Scripts capable of reading for manual analysis•Google and Azure both support network flows as well (see notes) | 1.135 | 
| Cloud Network Insights, GCP Flows | Cloud Network Insights is a tool that provides visibility into network traffic patterns and performance. Cloud Network Insights can be used to analyze network flows to identify bottlenecks, troubleshoot problems, and detect malicious activity. | 1.135 | 
| Cloud Logging, GCP Flows | Cloud Logging is a service that collects and stores logs from Google Cloud resources and applications. Cloud Logging can be used to collect flow logs, which can then be analyzed to identify patterns and trends. | 1.135 | 
| CloudWatch, AWS Flows|  allows you to analyze the logs directly within Amazon's platform. An S3 bucket allows you to use a SIEM or script to ingest the logs and analyze them automatically. | 1.135 |
| Azure Network Watcher, Flows |  provides a variety of tools for monitoring and troubleshooting Azure networks, including flow logging. Flow logs can be used to collect detailed information about network traffic, which can then be analyzed to identify patterns and trends. | 1.135 | 
| Azure Monitor, Flows | a unified monitoring platform that collects and analyzes data from a variety of sources, including Azure resources, on-premises servers, and applications. Azure Monitor can be used to analyze network flows to identify bottlenecks and other performance | 1.135 | 
| Suricata Flow | Suricata is an intrusion detection system that is also capable of network security monitoring (NSM); **Flow generation** is a key component of its capabilities.Flows can be generated unidirectionally or bidirectionally.**Unidirectional** means source -> destination and destination -> source are two flows. **Bidirectional:** means source <-> destination is one flow.Requires port mirroring or network taps | 1.137 | 
| Suricata BPF Filtering | Software controls exceptions. *see slide for example* ; Easy to ignore hosts; Easy to ignore networks; Easy to ignorecombinations of things; Allows eliminating duplicates | 1.138 | 
| Filtering Flows | Often results in Duplicaiton-flow data is generated at multi locals (routers).  Multiple strategies to handle it: **Traditional:** To lower chance of duplication;  Limit flow collection points;  Design for ingress or egress;  Use SDN fabricsTo eliminate storing duplicates;  Purchase commercial solution;  Send flows to it.  **Untraditional:** Software flows;  Conditionally log flow data Endpoint flows;  Conditionally log flow data | 1.139 | 
| Flow Components | Flow data requires the following components:; **Flow exporter** Switch, router, firewall, system, and so on that sendsflow records to a collector; **Flow collector** A system that collects flow records; Examples include fprobe, nprobe, and SiLK.; **Flow analyzer**; A system that analyzes and displays flow data; Examples include NfSen and ntopng.; **Some software offers combine flow collector andanalyzer functionality.;** Examples include SolarWinds and Scrutinizer. | 1.140 |

| NfSen NetFlow Analyzer | NFdump collector and NfSen NetFlow analyzer, FOSS... NfSen relies on RRDtool for generating the graphs, which is why the graphs shown above may look familiar to those who have used RRDtool (Round Robin Database Tool, available at: https://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/). The NfSen General Overview Page is shown above. | 1.141 | 
| ntopng | Flow analyzer, offers one of the easiest installations of the various free options. Installing on Ubuntu Linux is a breeze. The ntopng package repository is here: http://packages.ntop.org/ntopng requires PF_RING. ntopng will automatically collect local flows and uses nprobe to collect remote flows. Packages for PF_RING, ntopng, and nprobe for various operating systems are available at the repository linked above. | 1.142 |
| Cloud IaaS flow logs | need to be enabled; otherwise, connections outside the organization would not be logged. Example and reasons on slide and notes | 1.143 |
